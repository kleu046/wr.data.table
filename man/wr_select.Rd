\title{Function to subset data.table with selected columns/variables}
\usage{
wr_select(dt, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{a data.table}

\item{...}{column names, such as \code{mpg} or \code{drat}
will select the columns mpg and drat in mtcars; or
columns name as a range, such as \code{mpg:hp} will select all columns between
mpg and hp in mt cars}
}
\value{
a \code{data.table}
}
\description{
This function is used in similar way as \code{dplyr::select()}.
The column names for required columns are provided as expressions in \code{...}
to select the desired columns in a data.table.
}
\details{
The function selects the columns as stated in \code{...}.
A series of columns can selected in one go.  They can also be given as a range using
":" notation or as individual column names.

Do not input the column names as characters.

Different the \code{dplyr::select()} where user can select the data.frame / tibble
with the column prefixed with "-", this function is only used for selecting
columns/range of columns stated explicitly.  The function \link[wr.data.table]{wr_deselect} is
used instead to perform "negative select".

\examples{
\dontrun{
dt <- data.table(mtcars)
