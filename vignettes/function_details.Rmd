# Introduction

While ***data.table*** offers fast functions to tidy and summarize data, the syntax may often can often be hard to remember if not used or practised frequently.

This package aims to provide *wrapper functions* to carry out common tasks using functions in the data.table library without having to remember the data.table syntax.

This vignette outlines detail usages for these wrapper function

## data.table.withRownames()

This function converts a data.frame into a data.table and use the row names as the first column.

This is equivalent to:

> data.table(df, keep.rownames = True)

For examples, the *mtcars* contains car manufacturers and models as row names.

```{r wr_dt_withRrwnames, echo=TRUE}
dt <- wr_dt_withrownames(mtcars)

head(dt)
```

if a *data.table* is provided as arugment to this function, it does nothing but returning the input.

Inputs other than data.frame or data.table will result in an error.
